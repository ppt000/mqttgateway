# Configuration file for the "dummy" interface.
# Works with version 0.206 of mqttgateway.
# Use this as a template for full configuration.

# =================================================================================================
[INTERFACE]
# Section for whatever options are needed by the gateway interface
#   being developed. All these options will be written in a
#   dictionary and passed to the interface.

# example:
port: /dev/tty

# =================================================================================================
[MQTT]
# The parameters to connect to the MQTT broker
host: test.mosquitto.org
#port: 1883
#keepalive: 60

# The client id can be provided here; if left empty it defaults to the application name
#clientid:

# This is the timeout of the 'loop()' call in the MQTT library
#timeout: 0.01

# Mapping option. By default it is off.
#mapping: off

# Map file: there needs to be a mapping file if the <mapping> option is on.
#   If the <mapfilename> option is left blank, the mapping option is turned
#   off, whatever the value of the <mapping> option.
#   To use the default name and path, use a dot <.> for this option.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.map>.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
mapfilename: dummy_map.json

# The 'root' keyword for all MQTT messages.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the keyword should then be found in the mapping file.
root: home

# The topics to subscribe to, separated by a comma.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the topics should then be found in the mapping file.
topics: home/dummyfunction/#, home/+/dummy/#

# =================================================================================================
[LOG]
# Log file: all WARN level logs and above are sent to stderr or equivalent.
#   To log levels below that a file location is needed.
#   Leave this option blank to not enable a log file.
#   Use a dot <.> to use the default name and path.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.log>.
#   Make sure the process will have the rights to write in this file.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
logfilename:

# Turn debug 'on' if logging of all DEBUG level messages is required, otherwise its INFO
debug: on

# Console level: use NONE for no console output, otherwise the level wanted.
#   Logs will be directed to stdout.  Levels are the ones from the logging module:
#   CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN or WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.
consolelevel: DEBUG

# Email credentials; leave empty if not required.
#   All CRITICAL level logs are sent to this email, if defined.
#   For now there is no authentication.
emailhost:
# for example: emailhost: 127.0.0.1
emailport:
# for example: emailport: 25
emailaddress:
# for example: address: me@example.com

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rules for file paths and names:
#   - the default name is 'application_name' + default extension (.log, .map, ... etc);
#   - the default directories are:
#         (1) the configuration file location once loaded,
#         (2) the current working directory,
#         (3) the application directory, which 'should' be the location of the launching script;
#   - empty file paths have different meaning depending where they are used; best to avoid;
#   - file paths can be directory only (ends with a '/') and are appended with the default name;
#   - file paths can be absolute or relative; absolute start with a '/' and
#     relative are prepended with the default directory;
#   - file paths can be file only (no '/' whatsoever) and are prepended with
#     the default directory;
#   - use forward slashes '/' in any case, even for Windows systems, it should
#     work;
#   - however for Windows systems, use of the drive letter might be an issue
#     and has not been tested.
