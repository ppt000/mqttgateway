# Default configuration file for mqttgateway. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CONFIG]
# Reserved section used by the loader to store the location where
#   the configuration settings are coming from, or to store
#   the error if there was one.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INTERFACE]
# Section for whatever options are needed by the gateway interface
#   being developed. All these options will be written in a
#   dictionary and passed to the interface.

# Example:
#port: /dev/tty

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[MQTT]
# The parameters to connect to the MQTT broker
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 1883
keepalive: 60
username: username
password: password

# The client id can be provided here; if left empty it defaults to the application name
clientid:

# This is the timeout of the 'loop()' call in the MQTT library
timeout: 0.01

# Mapping option. By default it is off.
mapping: off

# Map file: there needs to be a mapping file if the <mapping> option is on.
#   If the <mapfilename> option is left blank, the mapping option is turned
#   off, whatever the value of the <mapping> option.
#   To use the default name and path, use a dot <.> for this option.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.map>.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
mapfilename: .

# The 'root' keyword for all MQTT messages.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the keyword should then be found in the mapping file.
#   By default it is empty ("").
# Example:
#root: home

root:

# The topics to subscribe to, separated by a comma.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the topics should then be found in the mapping file.
# Example:
#topics: home/lighting/#, home/+/mygateway/#

[LOG]
# Logs: all WARN level logs and above are sent to stderr or equivalent.
#   3 more log outputs can be set up: console, rotating files and email.
# Log levels: indicate what log levels are required for each log output.
#   Levels are indicated with the following strings (from the logging module):
#   CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN or WARNING, INFO and DEBUG; use NONE if unused.

# Console level: these are the logs directed to stdout.  Usually only used for testing.
consolelevel: NONE

# Log file: file location if logs to file is required.
#   Leave this option blank to not enable a log file.
#   Use a dot <.> to use the default name and path.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.log>.
#   Make sure the application will have the rights to write in this file.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
logfilename:

# File level: level for logs directed to the file named by the <logfilename> option.
#   If that option is blank, there is no file log whatever value is given to the option
#   <filelevel> (there is no default file).
filelevel: INFO

# Number of files required for the rotating files. Default is 3.
filenum:3

# Maximum size of each log file, in KB. Default is 50'000.
filesize: 50000

# Email credentials; leave empty if not required.
#   All CRITICAL level logs are sent to this email, if defined.
#   For now there is no authentication.
emailhost:
# for example: emailhost: 127.0.0.1
emailport:
# for example: emailport: 25
emailaddress:
# for example: address: me@example.com

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note on file paths and names:
#   - the default name is 'application_name' +
#                          default extension (.log, .map, ... etc);
#   - the default directories are (1) the configuration file location, (2) the
#     current working directory, (3) the application directory, which
#     'should' be the location of the launching script;
#   - empty file paths have different meaning depending where they are used;
#     best to avoid;
#   - file paths can be directory only (ends with a '/') and are appended with
#     the default name;
#   - file paths can be absolute or relative; absolute start with a '/' and
#     relative are prepended with the default directory;
#   - file paths can be file only (no '/' whatsoever) and are prepended with
#     the default directory;
#   - use forward slashes '/' in any case, even for Windows systems, it should
#     work;
#   - however for Windows systems, use of the drive letter might be an issue
#     and has not been tested.
