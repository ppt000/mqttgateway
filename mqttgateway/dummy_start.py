'''
Launcher script for the **dummy** gateway.

.. REVIEWED 11 November 2018

This is an *empty* gateway to test the installation setup.
It allows to test the loading of the configuration files,
the log setup and the basic operation of the core application.

One can also use this as a template.
If the name conventions have been respected, just change all occurrences of
``dummy`` into the name of your interface.
