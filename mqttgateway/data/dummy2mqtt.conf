# Configuration file for the "dummy" interface

[INTERFACE]

# Section for whatever options are needed by the gateway interface
#   being developed. All these options will be written in a
#   dictionary and passed to the interface.
# The 'port' option below is an example, delete it or replace it after testing
port: /dev/tty

# =====================================
[MQTT]

# The parameters to connect to the MQTT broker
host: 127.0.0.1
#port: 1883

# Mapping option. By default it is off.
mapping: off

# Map file: there needs to be a mapping file if the <mapping> option is on.
#   If the <mapfilename> option is left blank, the mapping option is turned
#   off, whatever the value of the <mapping> option.
#   To use the default name and path, use a dot <.> for this option.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.map>.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
mapfilename: ../data/

# The 'root' keyword for all MQTT messages.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the keyword should then be found in the mapping file.
root: home

# The topics to subscribe to, separated by a comma.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the topics should then be found in the mapping file.
topics: home/dummyfunction/#, home/+/dummy/#

# =====================================
[LOG]
# Log file: all WARN level logs and above are sent to syslog or equivalent.
#   To log levels below that a file location is needed.
#   Leave this option blank to not enable a log file - and therefore logs
#   of level below WARN will be lost.
#   Use a dot <.> to use the default name and path.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.log>.
#   Make sure the process will have the rights to write in this file.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
logfilename: ../data/

# Turn debug 'on' if logging of all debug messages is required, otherwise its INFO
debug: on

# Email credentials; leave empty if not required.
#   All CRITICAL level logs are sent to this email, if defined.
#   For now there is no authentication, it is only here for 'internal'
#   emails.
emailhost:
# for example: emailhost: 127.0.0.1
emailport:
# for example: emailport: 25
emailaddress:
# for example: address: me@example.com

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note on file paths (or file names):
#   - the default name is 'application_name' + default extension (.log, .map, ... etc);
#   - the default path is the 'application' directory, which 'should' be the location of the launching script;
#   - file paths can be empty in which case the default name and path will be used;
#   - file paths can be directory only (ends with a '/') and are appended with the default name;
#   - file paths can be absolute or relative; absolute start with a '/' and relative are prepended with the default directory;
#   - file paths can be file only (no '/' whatsoever) and are prepended with the default directory;
#   - use forward slashes '/' in any case, even for Windows systems, it should work;
#   - however for Windows systems, use of the drive letter might be an issue and has not been tested.
